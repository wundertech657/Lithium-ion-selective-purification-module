# Lithium-ion-selective-purification-module
In our project, we’re exploring an issue that arose during recent water analyses: certain wells showed notably elevated lithium levels above the generally accepted safe upper limit. While these concentrations fall into what the literature calls “micro‑ or low‑dose exposure,” the long‑term effects are still not fully understood. Some studies point to potential benefits, while others highlight concerns about mood and thyroid function. Even when serum lithium levels appear normal, that doesn’t necessarily rule out gradual accumulation in sensitive tissues.
This uncertainty is what inspired our project. We’re building a system to help monitor and reduce lithium levels in drinking water — but our main focus here, especially within the Blueprint program, is the electronics powering it. That’s the part we’re applying with, and that’s where we’re looking for guidance: designing the monitoring setup, integrating sensors, handling data, and making the whole thing reliable and user‑friendly.
The chemistry behind lithium removal is the project's real innovation, but that’s a field we’re already working on independently. What we want to refine through Blueprint is the electronic backbone that ties everything together: detection, control, feedback, and the logic that makes the system actually usable.
Our goal is to create a practical, modern approach to understanding and managing lithium exposure in drinking water — combining solid scientific foundations with accessible, well‑designed electronics.
